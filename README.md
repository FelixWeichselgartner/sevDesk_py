# Python API to sevDesk

Use Python to fetch customer data (or similar) from your [sevDesk](https://sevdesk.com/) account. I'm not affiliated or authorized by sevDesk. I'm just a customer that likes to automate.


## Usage

Setup:
* Have a valid [sevDesk](https://sevdesk.com/) account
* Create a `secret_data.py` file, which contains:
    * `sev_mail = "<your mail here>"`
    * `api_token = "<your api key here>`
* Check `test.py` to see how it works
